# Pet Image Segmentation with U-Net

This project implements a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of pet images using TensorFlow and the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.

# Overview

The notebook demonstrates the following key steps:

- Loading and preprocessing the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
- Implementing a U-Net model for image segmentation
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Visualizing results

# Usage

1. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the dataset, build the model, train, and evaluate.
2. The unet() function defines the model architecture.
3. Training progress and metrics are plotted for analysis.
4. Use the make_predictions() function to generate segmentation masks for test images.
5. Visualize results using the display_with_metrics() function.
