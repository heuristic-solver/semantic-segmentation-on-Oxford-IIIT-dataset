# Pet Image Segmentation with U-Net

This project implements a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of pet images using TensorFlow and the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.

# Overview

The notebook demonstrates the following key steps:

- Loading and preprocessing the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
- Implementing a U-Net model for image segmentation
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Visualizing results
